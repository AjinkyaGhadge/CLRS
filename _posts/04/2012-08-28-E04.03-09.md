> Solve the recurrence $$T(n) = 3T(\sqrt n) + \log n$$. by making a change of variables. Your solution should be asymptotically tight. Do not worry about whether values are integral.

**Note:** I don't why suddenly $$\log$$ is used in this problem statement, whereas till now everywhere $$\lg$$ was used. I'm assuming in this context, $$\log$$ still means $$\log_2 = \lg$$.

Let us assume $$n = 2^m$$, $$m = \lg n$$.

Hence, the recurrence takes the form

$$T(2^m) = 3T(2^{m/2}) + m$$.

Now, assuming $$S(m) = T(2^m)$$, the recurrence takes the form

$$S(m) = 3S(m/2) + m$$.

If you are not reading ahead and don't know Master theorem yet, it'll be really difficult to make good initial guess here. However, as [James Amaya](http://disq.us/p/19sug60) has pointed out in the comments section, we can identify a pattern in the solutions for recurrence relation.

If a recurrence is given by $$T(n) = aT(n / b) + f(n)$$, the solutions are usually of the form $$O(n^{log_b a})$$. This is heavily simplified, but nevertheless a good intuitive deduction. And you'll see that Master theorem states similar solution under certain conditions.
