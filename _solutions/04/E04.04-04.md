>Use a recursion tree to determine a good asymptotic upper bound on the recurrence $$T(n) = 2T(n - 1) + 1$$. Use the substitution method to verify your answer.

Rate of increase in number of subproblems in each recursion = 2
Rate of decrease in subproblem size = 1 with 1 less input

Hence in each level of the tree, there are $$2^i$$ nodes each of cost $$1$$ at depth $$i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n$$.

Hence, total cost of the tree is:

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} 2^i \cdot 1 \\
     & = \frac {2^{n + 1} - 1} {2 - 1} \\
     & = 2^{n + 1} - 1 \\
     & = 2.2^n - 1 \\
     & \le c2^n \\
     & = O(2^n)
\end {align}$$

The last step holds as long as $$c \ge 2$$ and $$n \ge 1$$.

Now we have to show that our guess $$T(n) = O(2^n)$$ holds using the substitution method. Let's refine our guess to $$T(n) \le d(2^n - b)$$ for positive constants $$b$$ and $$d$$.

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = 2T(n - 1) + 1 \\
     & \le 2d \cdot (2^{n - 1} - b) + 1 \\
     & = d2^n - 2db + 1 \\
     & = d2^n - db - (db - 1) \\
     & \le d(2^n - b)
\end {align}$$

The last step holds as long as $$db - 1 \ge 0$$.
