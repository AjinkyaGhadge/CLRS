>Use a recursion tree to determine a good asymptotic upper bound on the recurrence $$T(n) = T(n/2) + n^2$$. Use the substitution method to verify your answer.

Rate of increase in number of subproblems in each recursion = 1
Rate of decrease in subproblem size = 2

Hence in each level of the tree, there is only one node of cost $$c(n/2^i)^2$$ at depth $$i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, \lg n$$.

Hence, total cost of the tree is:

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = \sum_{i = 0}^{\lg n} c\left(\frac n {2^i}\right)^2 \\
     & = cn^2 \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{\lg n} \left(\frac 1 4\right)^i \\
     & \le cn^2 \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{\infty} \left(\frac 1 4\right)^i \\
     & = O(n^2)
\end {align}$$

The last step comes from the fact that the sum is independent of $$n$$, resulting in a constant factor.

Now we have to show that our guess $$T(n) = O(n^2)$$ holds using the substitution method.

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = T(n/2) + n^2 \\
     & \le d(n/2)^2 + n^2 \\
     & = d n^2/4 + n^2 \\
     & = (d/4 + 1) n^2 \\
     & \le dn^2
\end {align}$$

The last step holds as long as $$d \ge d/4 + 1$$, i.e. $$d \ge 4/3$$.
