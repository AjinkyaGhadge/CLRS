> Use the master method to show that the solution to the binary-search recurrence $$T(n) = T(n/2) + \Theta(1)$$ is $$T(n) = \Theta(\lg n)$$. (See [Exercise 2.3-5]({% link _solutions/02/E02.03-05.md %}) for a description of binary search.)

In the given recurrence, $$a = 1$$ and $$b = 2$$. Hence, $$n^{\log_b a} = n^0 = 1$$ and $$f(n) = \Theta(1) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a})$$. Hence case 2 of master method applies.

Hence, $$T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \lg n) = \Theta(\lg n)$$
