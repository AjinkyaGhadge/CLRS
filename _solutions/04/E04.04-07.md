>Draw the recursion tree for $$T(n) = 4T(\lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + cn$$, where $$c$$ is a constant, and provide a tight assymptotic bound on its solution. Verify your bound by the substitution method.

Ignoring the floors, the recusrion takes the form:

$$T(n) = 4T(n/2) + cn$$

Rate of increase in number of subproblems in each recursion = 4
Rate of decrease in subproblem size = 2

Hence in each level of the tree, there are $$4^i$$ nodes each of cost $$cn/2^i$$ at depth $$i = 0, 1, 2, \dots, \lg n$$.

Hence, total cost of the tree is:

$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = \sum_{i = 0}^{\lg n} 4^i \cdot c\frac n {2^i} \\
     & = cn \cdot \sum_{i = 0}^{\lg n} 2^i \\
     & = cn \cdot \frac {2^{\lg n + 1} - 1} {2 - 1} \\
     & = cn \cdot (2\cdot2^{\lg n} - 1) \\
     & = cn \cdot 2n - 2cn \\
     & = 2cn^2 - 2cn
\end {align}$$

Now, for assymptotic upper bound:
$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = 2cn^2 - 2cn \\
     & \le 2cn^2 \\
     & = O(n^2)
\end {align}$$


And, for assymptotic upper bound:
$$\begin {align}
T(n) & = 2cn^2 - 2cn \\
     & = cn^2 + (cn^2 - 2cn) \\
     & \ge cn^2 \\
     & = O(n^2)
\end {align}$$

Last step holds as long as $$n \ge 2$$.
